  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \

</Note>

## Create wallet pass

Create a pass that works on both Apple and Google wallets:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "passName": "My Wallet Pass",
    "passMetadata": {
      "description": "Welcome to our program",
      "organizationName": "Your Company",
      "backgroundColor": "#1a1a1a",
      "displayTextColor": "#ffffff",
      "topField": {
        "key": "member",
        "label": "Member",
        "value": "Gold Status"
      },
      "secondaryFields": [
        {
          "key": "points",
          "label": "Points",
          "value": "2,500"
        }
      ]
    },
    "uploadInfoList": [
      {
        "fileName": "logo.png",
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-abc123"
      },
      {
        "fileName": "icon.png", 
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-def456"
      },
      {
        "fileName": "strip.png",
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-ghi789"
      }
    ],
    "status": "Published"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "pass-123",
  "passName": "My Wallet Pass",
  "passLink": "https://passes.example.com/download/pass-123",
  "status": "Published",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## How passes appear

Your pass will automatically adapt to each platform:

**Apple Wallet (iOS):**
- Clean, minimal design following Apple's guidelines
- Shows organization name, logo, and key fields
- Supports lock screen notifications

**Google Wallet (Android):**
- Material Design styling with your brand colors
- Displays all fields with clear hierarchy
- Integrates with Google services

## Pass distribution

Share your pass with users:

- **Direct link** - Send the `passLink` via email or SMS
- **QR code** - Generate QR codes linking to your pass
- **Website integration** - Add download buttons to your site

When users tap the link:
- **iOS devices** - Opens directly in Apple Wallet
- **Android devices** - Opens in Google Wallet
- **Desktop** - Shows download instructions

## Pass fields structure

Configure your pass fields for optimal display:

```json
{
  "topField": {
    "key": "status",
    "label": "Status", 
    "value": "VIP Member"
  },
  "secondaryFields": [
    {
      "key": "points",
      "label": "Points",
      "value": "2,500"
    },
    {
      "key": "tier",
      "label": "Tier",
      "value": "Gold"
    }
  ],
  "auxiliaryFields": [
    {
      "key": "member_since",
      "label": "Member Since",
      "value": "Jan 2024"
    }
  ]
}
```
