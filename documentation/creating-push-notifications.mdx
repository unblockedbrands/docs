Send immediate push notifications to users with wallet passes on their devices

## Prerequisites

- An Unblocked account
- An API key
- A published wallet pass with at least one user download

## Send immediate notification

Send a push notification right away to pass holders:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass/{passId}/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Your loyalty points have been updated!",
    "type": "immediate"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "notif-789",
  "passId": "pass-123", 
  "message": "Your loyalty points have been updated!",
  "type": "immediate",
  "status": "sent",
  "sentAt": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z",
  "recipientCount": 145
}
```

## Schedule notification

Schedule a notification to be sent at a specific time:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass/{passId}/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "message": "Special offer expires tomorrow!",
    "type": "scheduled",
    "scheduledFor": "2025-01-18T09:00:00Z"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "notif-790",
  "passId": "pass-123",
  "message": "Special offer expires tomorrow!",
  "type": "scheduled", 
  "status": "scheduled",
  "scheduledFor": "2025-01-18T09:00:00Z",
  "estimatedRecipients": 145
}
```

## How notifications appear

When users receive your push notification:

**On iOS (Apple Wallet):**
- Notification appears on lock screen and notification center
- Shows your organization name and message
- Tapping opens the pass in Apple Wallet

**On Android (Google Wallet):**
- Notification appears in notification panel
- Shows pass name and your message
- Tapping opens the pass in Google Wallet

## Notification message guidelines

- **Keep it short** - Maximum 160 characters for best display
- **Be specific** - "Points updated: 250 pts" vs "Update available"
- **Add urgency** - "Expires tomorrow" or "Limited time"
- **Avoid spam** - Don't send too frequently to the same users
