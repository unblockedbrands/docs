  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "notificationName": "Loyalty Points Update",
    "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
    "notificationMessage": "Your loyalty points have been updated!"
  }'
```

**Response:**

{
  "id": "notif-789",
  "notificationName": "Loyalty Points Update",
  "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
  "notificationMessage": "Your loyalty points have been updated!",
  "status": "Published",
  "publishedTime": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z",

}
```

## Schedule notification

Schedule a notification to be sent at a specific time:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass/notifications' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "notificationName": "Special Offer Expiry",
    "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
    "notificationMessage": "Special offer expires tomorrow!",
    "scheduledTime": "2025-01-18T09:00:00Z",
    "status": "Scheduled"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "notif-790",
  "notificationName": "Special Offer Expiry",
  "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
  "notificationMessage": "Special offer expires tomorrow!",
  "status": "Scheduled",
  "scheduledTime": "2025-01-18T09:00:00Z",
  "createdTime": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## How notifications appear

When users receive your push notification:

**On iOS (Apple Wallet):**
- Notification appears on lock screen and notification center
- Shows your organization name and message
- Tapping opens the pass in Apple Wallet

**On Android (Google Wallet):**
- Notification appears in notification panel
- Shows pass name and your message
- Tapping opens the pass in Google Wallet

## Notification message guidelines

- **Keep it short** - Maximum 160 characters for best display
- **Be specific** - "Points updated: 250 pts" vs "Update available"
- **Add urgency** - "Expires tomorrow" or "Limited time"
- **Avoid spam** - Don't send too frequently to the same users
