# Creating Your First Pass

A complete walkthrough of creating, customizing, and publishing your first wallet pass

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have created a fully functional wallet pass that users can add to their Apple Wallet or Google Pay.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Prepare Your Assets

Before creating a pass, gather these required images:

- **Logo** (160x50px) - Displayed at the top of the pass
- **Icon** (29x29px) - Small icon for notifications  
- **Strip** (375x123px) - Background image for the pass
- **Footer** (295x15px) - Optional footer image

<Tip>
Images should be in PNG format with transparent backgrounds where appropriate.
</Tip>

### 2. Upload Your Images

Upload each image and save the upload keys:

```bash
# Upload logo
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/uploads' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -F 'file=@logo.png'

# Upload icon  
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/uploads' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -F 'file=@icon.png'

# Upload strip
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/uploads' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -F 'file=@strip.png'
```

### 3. Create Your Pass

Now create the pass with your branding and content:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "passName": "Loyalty Card",
    "passMetadata": {
      "description": "Your membership card for exclusive benefits",
      "organizationName": "Your Business Name",
      "backgroundColor": "#000000",
      "displayTextColor": "#ffffff",
      "topField": {
        "key": "member",
        "label": "Member ID",
        "value": "12345"
      },
      "secondaryFields": [
        {
          "key": "name",
          "label": "Name", 
          "value": "John Doe"
        },
        {
          "key": "tier",
          "label": "Tier",
          "value": "Gold"
        }
      ]
    },
    "uploadInfoList": [
      {"fileName": "logo.png", "uploadKey": "your-logo-key"},
      {"fileName": "icon.png", "uploadKey": "your-icon-key"},
      {"fileName": "strip.png", "uploadKey": "your-strip-key"}
    ],
    "status": "Published"
  }'
```

### 4. Test Your Pass

The API returns a `passLink` that you can use to test:

```json
{
  "id": "pass-abc123",
  "passName": "Loyalty Card", 
  "passLink": "https://passes.unblocked.com/pass-abc123",
  "status": "Published"
}
```

Open the `passLink` on your phone to add the pass to your wallet!

## Customization Options

### Colors and Branding
- Use your brand colors for `backgroundColor` and `displayTextColor`
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Test on both light and dark device themes

### Fields and Content
- **Top Field** - Most prominent information (member ID, balance, etc.)
- **Secondary Fields** - Additional details in smaller text
- **Back Fields** - Detailed information on the back of the pass

### QR Codes
Add QR codes for easy scanning:

```json
"passMetadata": {
  "qrUrl": "https://yoursite.com/redeem/12345",
  "qrText": "Scan to redeem points"
}
```
