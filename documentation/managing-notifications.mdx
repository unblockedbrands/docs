# Managing Notifications

Send targeted push notifications to users who have added your wallet passes

## Prerequisites

- A published wallet pass
- At least one user with the pass added to their wallet
- An API key

## Creating a Notification

Send a notification to all users who have a specific pass:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
    "notificationName": "Welcome Message",
    "notificationMessage": "Welcome to our loyalty program! Earn points with every purchase."
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "notification-456",
  "notificationName": "Welcome Message",
  "status": "Published",
  "totalNotificationSentCount": 1247,
  "publishedTime": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Scheduling Notifications

Schedule a notification to be sent at a specific time:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "passSerialNumber": "pass-123",
    "notificationName": "Holiday Sale",
    "notificationMessage": "ðŸŽ‰ 50% off everything! Limited time only.",
    "status": "Scheduled",
    "scheduledTime": "2025-01-20T09:00:00Z"
  }'
```

## Notification Status

Notifications can have different statuses:

- **Draft** - Notification created but not sent
- **Scheduled** - Notification will be sent at a specific time
- **Processing** - Notification is currently being sent
- **Published** - Notification has been sent successfully
- **Failed** - Notification failed to send

## Best Practices

### Message Content
- Keep messages under 178 characters for optimal display
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include relevant emojis to catch attention
- Test messages on different devices

### Timing
- Consider your audience's time zones
- Avoid sending during late night hours
- Space out notifications to prevent fatigue

## Tracking Performance

```
