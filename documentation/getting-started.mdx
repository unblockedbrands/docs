# Getting Started

Create your first Apple and Google wallet pass using the Unblocked Wallet Passes API

## Prerequisites

- An Unblocked account
- An API key
- Basic understanding of REST APIs

## Your First Wallet Pass

To create a wallet pass, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Upload your pass assets** (logo, icon, strip images)
2. **Create the wallet pass** with metadata
3. **Publish the pass** to make it available for download

### Step 1: Upload Pass Assets

First, upload the required images for your pass:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/uploads' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@logo.png'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "key": "upload-key-abc123",
  "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/upload-key-abc123"
}
```

<Note>
You'll need to upload at least three images: logo.png, icon.png, and strip.png. Footer.png is optional.
</Note>

### Step 2: Create the Wallet Pass

Now create your wallet pass using the upload keys:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "passName": "My First Pass",
    "passMetadata": {
      "description": "Welcome to our loyalty program",
      "organizationName": "Your Company",
      "backgroundColor": "#1a1a1a",
      "displayTextColor": "#ffffff",
      "topField": {
        "key": "member",
        "label": "Member",
        "value": "Gold Status"
      }
    },
    "uploadInfoList": [
      {
        "fileName": "logo.png",
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-abc123"
      },
      {
        "fileName": "icon.png", 
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-def456"
      },
      {
        "fileName": "strip.png",
        "uploadKey": "upload-key-ghi789"
      }
    ],
    "status": "Published"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "pass-123",
  "passName": "My First Pass",
  "passLink": "https://passes.example.com/download/pass-123",
  "status": "Published",
  "createdTime": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z"
}
```
