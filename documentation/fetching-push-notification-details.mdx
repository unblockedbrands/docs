```

    "pending": 0
  }
}
```

## List all notifications for a pass

Get all notifications sent to a specific pass:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass/notifications?passSerialNumber={passId}' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "notif-789",
      "message": "Your loyalty points have been updated!",
      "type": "immediate",
      "status": "sent",
      "sentAt": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z",
      "recipientCount": 145

      "estimatedRecipients": 145
    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}
```

## List all notifications

Get all notifications across all your passes:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass/notifications' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>'
```

## Filter notifications by status

Retrieve notifications by their current status:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass/notifications?status=scheduled' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>'
```

## Understanding notification status

Your notifications can have the following statuses:

- **sent** - Notification has been delivered to devices
- **scheduled** - Notification is queued for future delivery
- **failed** - Notification delivery failed (check error details)
- **cancelled** - Scheduled notification was cancelled before sending

## Delivery statistics

For sent notifications, you can track:

- **delivered** - Successfully delivered to devices
- **failed** - Failed to deliver (device offline, etc.)
- **pending** - Still being delivered (for large recipient lists)
