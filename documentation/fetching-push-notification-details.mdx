  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>'
```

      "type": "immediate",
      "status": "sent",
      "sentAt": "2025-01-17T14:30:00Z",

    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}
```

## List all notifications

Get all notifications across all your passes:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>'
```

## Filter notifications by status

Retrieve notifications by their current status:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/notifications?status=scheduled' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>'
```

## Understanding notification status

Your notifications can have the following statuses:

- **sent** - Notification has been delivered to devices
- **scheduled** - Notification is queued for future delivery
- **failed** - Notification delivery failed (check error details)
- **cancelled** - Scheduled notification was cancelled before sending

## Delivery statistics

For sent notifications, you can track:

- **delivered** - Successfully delivered to devices
- **failed** - Failed to deliver (device offline, etc.)
- **pending** - Still being delivered (for large recipient lists)
