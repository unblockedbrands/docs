Send automatic push notifications when users enter or exit specific geographic areas

## Prerequisites

- An Unblocked account
- An API key
- A published wallet pass
- Location coordinates (latitude/longitude)

## Add location to pass

Configure a geographic area that will trigger notifications:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass-location' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Main Store Location",
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "relevantText": "Welcome to our store! Show this pass for 10% off.",
    "enabled": true,
    "passSerialNumber": "{passId}"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "location-456",
  "name": "Main Store Location",
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "relevantText": "Welcome to our store! Show this pass for 10% off.",
  "enabled": true,
  "createdTime": "2025-01-17T15:00:00Z",
  "workspaceId": "workspace-123"
}
```

## Toggle location trigger

Enable or disable location-based notifications:

```bash
curl -X PUT 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass-location/{locationId}' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "enabled": false
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "location-456",
  "name": "Main Store Location",
  "enabled": false,
  "updatedTime": "2025-01-17T16:00:00Z"
}
```

## List pass locations

Get all configured locations for a pass:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass-location?passSerialNumbers={passId}' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "location-456",
      "name": "Main Store",
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194,
      "relevantText": "Welcome to our store!",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "id": "location-457", 
      "name": "Second Store",
      "latitude": 37.7849,
      "longitude": -122.4094,
      "relevantText": "Visit our second location!",
      "enabled": false
    }
  ],
  "cursor": null,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

## How location notifications work

When users approach your configured locations:

**Automatic triggering:**
- Device detects user entering the geographic area
- Push notification sent immediately  
- Pass appears on lock screen (iOS) or as notification (Android)

**User experience:**
- Notification shows your custom message
- Tapping opens the pass in their wallet
- "Relevant Text" appears on the pass when nearby

## Location configuration

**Radius guidelines:**
- **Small venues** (shops): 50-100 meters
- **Large venues** (malls): 200-500 meters  
- **Events/stadiums**: 500-1000 meters
- **Maximum**: 1000 meters (iOS limitation)

**Message best practices:**
- Include specific action: "Show pass for discount"
- Add urgency: "Limited time offer"
- Keep under 160 characters
- Mention location: "Welcome to Downtown Store"

## Remove location

Delete a location trigger from a pass:

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.ubpass.co/v1/wallet-pass-location/{locationId}' \
  -H 'api-key: <your-api-key>'
```
