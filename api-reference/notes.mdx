## General Notes

This page contains important information and best practices for working with the Unblocked Brands API.

## API Usage

### Rate Limiting
- API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage and system stability
- If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response
- Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic

### Authentication
- Always include your API key in the `api-key` header
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- Rotate your API keys regularly for security

### Workspace ID
- The `x-workspace-id` header is optional for most endpoints
- If not provided, the system will use the first workspace assigned to your account
- Provide this header when working with multiple workspaces

## Pique API

### Campaign Analytics
- Analytics data may take up to 24 hours to reflect in the API
- Video performance metrics are updated in real-time
- Campaign data is aggregated hourly

### Boosted Post
- Instagram Reels must meet minimum quality requirements
- Organic boosting typically shows results within 48-72 hours
- Monitor engagement metrics to optimize future campaigns

### Syndicated Content
- Content remixing preserves your brand guidelines
- Micro-influencers are vetted for quality and authenticity
- Distribution timeline varies by platform (TikTok vs Instagram)

## Passport API

### Pass Creation
- Always test passes in sandbox mode before going live
- Apple Wallet and Google Wallet have different asset requirements
- Passes are immutable once distributed - use updates instead of deletions

### Push Notifications
- Notifications are delivered in near real-time
- Draft notifications can be edited before scheduling
- Scheduled notifications can be cancelled before delivery

### Location-Based Features
- Geofencing uses 15-minute batch scheduling
- Location notifications require user permission
- Test geofence radius for optimal performance (recommended: 100-500 meters)

### Asset Management
- Upload assets before creating passes
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG (PNG recommended for transparency)
- Image size limits apply per platform requirements

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Always check HTTP status codes in responses
- Parse error messages from the `errorCode` field
- Use the `txId` field for support requests

### Testing
- Use test API keys during development
- Validate all request payloads against the schema
- Test edge cases (missing fields, invalid data)

### Performance
- Batch operations when possible to reduce API calls
- Cache responses where appropriate
- Use pagination for large result sets

## Support

If you encounter issues or have questions:
- Check the error response `txId` for troubleshooting
- Review the API documentation for endpoint-specific details
- Contact support with specific error messages and request IDs
