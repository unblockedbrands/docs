Welcome to the Passport API! This API allows you to programmatically create, manage, and distribute digital wallet passes for Apple Wallet and Google Pay.

## What you can do

With the Passport API, you can:

- **Update Passes** - Update details about the passes you've already created
- **Manage Pass locations** - Add and update location-based features for your passes
- **Send notifications** - Push real-time updates to users' devices
- **Search and retrieve** - Find and get details of passes and notifications you've created

## Getting started

To get started:

1. **Get your API key** - Create an API key from your Passport dashboard
2. **Make your first request** - Try the endpoints in the interactive playground below
3. **Build your integration** - Check out our guides for creating different pass types

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1
```

## Authentication

All requests require authentication using an API key in the api-key header:

```bash
api-key: ub_live_your_api_key_here
```

## Rate limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage and system stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
