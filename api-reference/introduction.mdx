This API platform enables you to integrate with our two core products: **Pique** for social content syndication and **Passport** for digital wallet pass management.

## What you can do

### With Pique

Pique is our social boosting and content syndication platform that helps brands amplify their reach through creator networks. We offer two distinct services:

**Boosted Post** - Organically boost views for Instagram Reels. Our network drives authentic engagement to amplify your existing content and increase visibility without paid ads.

**Syndicated Content** - We remix and distribute your content to be posted by micro-influencers on TikTok and Instagram. This service transforms your brand content into creator-led posts for authentic reach.

The Pique API allows you to access comprehensive analytics for campaigns you run with us, including engagement metrics, video performance data, and strategic insights.

### With Passport

Passport enables you to create and manage digital passes for Apple Wallet and Google Wallet. The Passport API allows you to:

- **Send push notifications** - Deliver timely updates and offers directly to pass holders
- **Create digital passes** - Design and distribute branded passes to your customers
- **Set up location-based notifications** - Configure geofenced areas to trigger notifications when users are nearby
- **Manage locations** - Add and update physical locations associated with your passes
