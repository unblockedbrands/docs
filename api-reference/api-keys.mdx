API keys allow you to access your Passport account programmatically and integrate wallet passes into your applications.

Each API key inherits the permissions of the user who created it, giving access to all of that user's resources.

## Creating an API key

You can create an API key by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to settings">
    Go to **Settings** > **API keys**.

    <img
      src="/images/auth/api-key-settings.png"
      alt="Settings page with API tab highlighted"
    />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    Click **"Create API key"** and give it a descriptive name.

    <img
      src="/images/auth/api-key-create.png"
      alt="Create API key form"
    />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store your API key">
    Once your API key is created, make sure to copy and store it in a safe place. You won't be able to see it again for security reasons. If it gets lost, you can create a new one.

    <img
      src="/images/auth/api-key-copy.png"
      alt="Generated API key with copy button highlighted"
    />

    <Warning>
      Your API key grants full access to your Passport account. Keep it secure and never share it publicly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use your API key">
    Now that you have your API key, you can use it to access your account's resources programmatically via any API request as a bearer token.

    ```bash
    Authorization: Bearer ub_live_xxxx
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
```

### Example with a Real Request

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ub_live_abc123xyz456...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Authentication Errors

If your API key is missing, invalid, or malformed, you'll receive authentication errors:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing API Key (401 Unauthorized)">
    ```json
    {
      "txId": "req-123",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
      "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED", 
      "errorMessage": "Missing Authorization header"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid API Key (403 Forbidden)">
    ```json
    {
      "txId": "req-456",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
      "errorCode": "FORBIDDEN",
      "errorMessage": "Invalid API key"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Storage" icon="lock">
    - Use environment variables in production
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use different keys for development and production
    - Rotate keys regularly for security
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rate Limiting" icon="gauge">
    - API requests are rate limited to prevent abuse
    - Include proper error handling for `429` responses
    - Implement exponential backoff for retries
    - Cache responses when possible
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment Setup Examples

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
// .env file
PASSPORT_API_KEY=ub_live_your_api_key_here

// app.js
const API_KEY = process.env.PASSPORT_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
# .env file  
PASSPORT_API_KEY=ub_live_your_api_key_here

import os
import requests

API_KEY = os.getenv('PASSPORT_API_KEY')

response = requests.get(
    'https://wallet-pass-api-staging.nftco.com/v1/wallet-pass',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
When you remove a user from your organization (or they leave your organization), all API keys associated with that user will stop working as well. Keep this in mind when managing users.
