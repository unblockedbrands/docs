# AccessToken Authentication Configuration (Hidden)
# Date: 2025-09-24
# Reason: Simplified authentication to use API Key only

## What was changed:
The global security configuration was updated from:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "AccessToken": []
  },
  {
    "APIKey": []
  }
],
```

To:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "APIKey": []
  }
],
```

## AccessToken Security Scheme (Still Present):
The AccessToken security scheme is still defined in the components/securitySchemes section:

```json
"AccessToken": {
  "type": "http",
  "description": "Bearer token authentication",
  "scheme": "bearer",
  "bearerFormat": "JWT"
}
```

## How to restore:
1. Run the restore script: `./restore_access_token.sh`
2. Or manually add back the AccessToken object to the security array

## Notes:
- Only the global security setting was changed
- The AccessToken security scheme definition remains intact
- This allows easy restoration when needed in the future
